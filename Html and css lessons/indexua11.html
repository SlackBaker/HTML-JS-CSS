                         C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language
                         C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.

                        C++ is an object-oriented programming language.

                        Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

                        Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

                        A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

                        class MyClass {       // The class

                            public:             // Access specifier

                        Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.

                        When we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived class inherits all the properties of the base class, without changing the properties of base class and may add new features to its own. These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.
